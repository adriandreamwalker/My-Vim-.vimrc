# My-Vim-.vimrc

This is just a copya of my .vimrc file.
I'm learning how to use Vim, and also have two machines. Therefore, for ease of changing
workin environment, I'll have this here.
If you catch this file later on, it'll have much more configuration and, I promise,
it'll be much more sexier than now.


(as of june 19 2022...)
Be well!
